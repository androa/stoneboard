# Stoneboard - A GitHub milestone visualizer

It iterates through all projects a user has access to, in the configured organisations, and fetches milestones and issues. These are then displayed in a graph visualising the milestone relationships.

Specify milestones dependencies by adding this to a milestone description. For example:

`[blah/gh-dashboard-test-three/3 blah/gh-dashboard-test-three/2]`

This tells us the milestone has two dependencies; milestone 2 and 3 in the repo “gh-dashboard-test-three” in the organisation “blah”.
